# Multi Model Tester

Use this tool if you want a comparison of AI models running the same prompt/task to check how Modelfile changes effect your models. This will give you a quick performance evaluation, allowing users to assess response times, output quality, and the fastest way to see the impact of Modelfile parameter changes. If constantly comparing different fine-tuned models or want to optimize their performance, save some time and try this. I made it for you

## Features:
- **Run multiple models**: Test a wide range of models and compare their results.
- **Measure performance**: Automatically measure and log the time it takes for each model to process the prompt.
- **Save Results**: View and save model responses, performance times, and charts (Google Charts) to easily compare models.
- **Chart generation**: Generate an HTML report with a Google Chart visualizing the average time taken by each model.
- **JSON export**: Save all results and responses in a structured JSON file for easy access and analysis.

## Installation

### Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies for the program, use the following command:

```bash
bun install
```

## Usage

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the program using:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

### Results Files:

- `data/results.json`: Contains the model responses and performance times for each round of testing.
- `data/comparison_report.html`: Contains a Google Charts visualization comparing the average response times of each model.

## Charting:

If you do not need a chart you can easily disable the chart generation by changing the `enableChart` variable to `false` in the script. This will stop the program from generating and saving the chart, saving processing power.

```typescript
const enableChart = false; // Set to true to enable chart generation
```

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of what the terminal output might look like after running a few tests:

```
Testing model: Model1
Round 1: Response from model1...
Generated in 1.25 seconds

Round 2: Response from model1...
Generated in 1.20 seconds

Average Time: 1.23 seconds

Results saved to data/results.json
Chart generated: data/comparison_report.html
```
